			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>Sometimes I have difficulty figuring out what to eat. Instead of spending my delicious time eating, I spend it pondering about all my choices. Alas, I have fallen victim to indecisiveness! Fear not! If you also suffer from this, my randomizer is your cure!</p>
			<p>Now you just have to decide if you want your food destiny to be completely random or if you want to have a say in it! It's not my fault if you spend countless hours deciding between the two.</p>
